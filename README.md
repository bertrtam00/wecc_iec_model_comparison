# wecc_iec_model_comparison
Comparison of generic electrical wind turbine models following WECC and IEC standards

## IEC_and_WECC_WT_SMIB.mo
is the first test case with IEC and WECC running in parallel.

## Available test cases
- test001_StepP consists in a step on PRef at the turbine.
- test002_StepQ consists in a step on QRef at the turbine.
- test003_SolidFault consists in a solid fault (R = 0, X= 0.0001 pu) at the turbine terminal from t = 5 to t = 5.1 s
- test004_StepU consists in a step on URef at the turbine.
