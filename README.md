## IEC_and_WECC_WT_SMIB.mo
is the first test case with IEC and WECC running in parallel.

## Available test cases
- test001_StepP consists in a step on PRef at the turbine.
- test002_StepQ consists in a step on QRef at the turbine.
- test003_SolidFault consists in a solid fault (R = 0, X= 0.0001 pu) at the turbine terminal from t = 5 to t = 5.1 s

| 2   |           | WECC: has extra min limit for reactive current during FRT (iql1); IEC uses minimum limit from normal path                                             |         |
| 3   |           | IEC has local voltage drop compensation (WECC REEC_A doesn't)                                                                                         |         |
